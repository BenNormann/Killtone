# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KILLtONE game framework initializes the Babylon.js engine and scene successfully but displays only a black screen because no camera is set as the active camera and existing manager systems are not being instantiated or initialized. The game needs to properly connect and initialize the existing manager classes and set up a player properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game to have an active camera after initialization, so that the Babylon.js scene renders visibly instead of showing a black screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the system SHALL create and set an active camera for the scene
2. WHEN the camera is created THEN the system SHALL position it at a reasonable default location
3. WHEN the scene renders THEN the system SHALL display the rendered view through the active camera
4. WHEN no other camera is specified THEN the system SHALL use a basic free camera as default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing manager systems to be properly instantiated and initialized, so that all game functionality is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the system SHALL instantiate all existing manager classes
2. WHEN managers are instantiated THEN the system SHALL call their initialization methods
3. WHEN managers are initialized THEN the system SHALL integrate them with the main game loop
4. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL call update methods on all active managers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game loop to start automatically after initialization, so that the game begins running immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initialization completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically start the game loop
2. WHEN the game loop starts THEN the system SHALL begin calling the update and render methods
3. WHEN the render loop is active THEN the system SHALL continuously render the scene
4. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame timing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback about the initialization process, so that I can identify what systems are active and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each initialization step completes THEN the system SHALL log success messages
2. WHEN managers are instantiated THEN the system SHALL log which managers are active
3. WHEN the game loop starts THEN the system SHALL confirm the game is running
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error information and continue with fallback behavior
