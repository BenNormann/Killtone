# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KILLtONE is a futuristic cyber city FPS game built with Babylon.js that features dynamic audio-visual feedback systems, comprehensive game management, and integrated development tools. The game implements a unique kill-streak system where eliminations increase music volume and apply visual effects to highlight players. The framework needs to be scalable, modern, and follow best coding practices while incorporating existing audio and effects systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want a responsive game framework that manages all game states and systems, so that I can have a smooth gaming experience with proper initialization and cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all core game systems in the correct order
2. WHEN transitioning between game states THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup previous state resources
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing the entire game
4. IF the browser loses focus THEN the system SHALL pause non-critical systems to preserve performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want a loading screen that shows game initialization progress, so that I understand what's happening during startup and feel engaged while waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading screen with progress indicators
2. WHEN assets are being loaded THEN the system SHALL show real-time loading progress with percentages
3. WHEN loading completes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the main menu
4. IF loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want a main menu that also serves as an in-game settings menu accessible via ESC, so that I can configure game settings both before and during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a main menu with game options
2. WHEN I press ESC during gameplay THEN the system SHALL pause the game and show the settings overlay
3. WHEN I'm in the settings menu THEN the system SHALL allow me to adjust audio, graphics, and control settings
4. WHEN I apply settings changes THEN the system SHALL update the game configuration immediately
5. WHEN I close the settings menu THEN the system SHALL resume gameplay seamlessly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the kill-streak audio-visual system to work seamlessly with the game framework, so that I get immediate feedback when eliminating opponents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I eliminate an opponent THEN the system SHALL increase the music volume incrementally
2. WHEN I get a kill THEN the system SHALL highlight all visible players with red effects
3. WHEN the kill-streak ends THEN the system SHALL gradually return audio and visual effects to normal
4. WHEN multiple kills occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL stack effects appropriately without performance issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want an integrated map maker and editor accessible from the main menu, so that I can create and modify game levels without external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the map editor THEN the system SHALL provide tools for placing objects, terrain, and spawn points
2. WHEN I'm editing a map THEN the system SHALL allow real-time preview and testing
3. WHEN I save a map THEN the system SHALL store it in a format compatible with the game engine
4. WHEN I load a custom map THEN the system SHALL validate and integrate it with existing game systems
5. IF I make invalid map configurations THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular and scalable architecture that integrates existing audio and effects systems, so that the codebase remains maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating existing systems THEN the framework SHALL maintain compatibility with current audio and effects implementations
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns and interfaces
3. WHEN the game scales THEN the architecture SHALL support additional maps, weapons, and game modes
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the modular design SHALL allow optimization of individual systems

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive controls and smooth gameplay mechanics, so that the game feels competitive and enjoyable like Krunker.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I move or aim THEN the system SHALL respond with minimal input lag
2. WHEN I shoot THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual and audio feedback
3. WHEN multiple players are active THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates
4. WHEN network events occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without disrupting local gameplay

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to properly manage resources and memory, so that I can play for extended periods without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL dispose of them properly
2. WHEN switching between game modes THEN the system SHALL clean up unused resources
3. WHEN the game runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
4. IF memory usage becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection strategies
