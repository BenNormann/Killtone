## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1** - Essential for basic functionality
2. **Phase 2** - Core gameplay mechanics  
3. **Phase 3** - Map editor (can be developed in parallel with Phase 2)
4. **Phase 4** - Polish and advanced features

### Context Window Management
- Each phase is designed to be implemented incrementally
- Individual tasks are focused and manageable
- Can pause between phases for review and testing
- Each task builds on previous completed tasks

### Existing System Integration
- Phase 1 focuses heavily on integrating your existing AudioManager and FlowstateEffects
- Maintains all current functionality while adding framework benefits
- Preserves your existing asset loading patterns

### Babylon.js Leverage Strategy
- Use built-in systems wherever possible (GizmoManager, ParticleSystem, etc.)
- Focus custom code on game logic and coordination
- Avoid rebuilding what Babylon.js already provides
