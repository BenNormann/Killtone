# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create NameGenerator utility class





  - Create src/utils/NameGenerator.js with random name generation functionality
  - Implement generateRandomName() method with predefined name parts
  - Add name validation and uniqueness checking methods
  - Write unit tests to verify name generation works correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [x] 2. Extend Player class with name functionality




  - Add name property to Player class constructor
  - Implement setName() and getName() methods in Player class
  - Add name validation logic using NameGenerator
  - Initialize player with random generated name on creation
  - Update Player class to store name in local storage for persistence
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5_

- [x] 3. Add nametag input field to main menu UI




  - Modify UIManager.showMainMenu() to include nametag input field
  - Position nametag input between killtone setting and PLAY button
  - Implement input validation and character limits (1-20 characters)
  - Connect input field to Player.setName() method
  - Display current player name in the input field on menu load
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Update server to handle player names




  - Extend server player data structure to include name field
  - Modify player initialization in server.js to accept name from client
  - Add socket event handler for name updates ('nameUpdate')
  - Implement server-side name validation and uniqueness checking
  - Broadcast name changes to all connected clients
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance RemotePlayer nametag rendering




  - Update RemotePlayer constructor to use player.name instead of generic text
  - Modify createNameTag() method to display actual player names
  - Ensure nametag positioning and visibility works with real names
  - Test nametag rendering with various name lengths
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5_

- [x] 6. Update networking to synchronize names




  - Modify client-side socket connection to send player name on join
  - Update playerUpdate events to include name changes
  - Handle name synchronization when players join/leave
  - Implement retry logic for failed name broadcasts
  - Test name synchronization across multiple clients
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 7. Fix leaderboard to display proper player information
  - Update leaderboard data structure to use player names instead of generic text
  - Modify _getLeaderboardData() method to pull real player data from server
  - Ensure leaderboard shows accurate kill and death counts
  - Update leaderboard entries to display player.name
  - Test leaderboard updates when players join/leave and get kills/deaths
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Integrate all components and test end-to-end functionality
  - Test complete flow: name generation → menu display → server sync → nametag display → leaderboard
  - Verify name persistence across game sessions
  - Test multiple players with different names simultaneously
  - Ensure existing game functionality remains unaffected
  - Verify performance with nametag system active
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
