# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a lightweight player nametag system that allows players to have randomly generated names, displays these names above players in-game, and updates the existing leaderboard with proper player information including names, kills, and deaths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to have a randomly generated nametag when I join the game, so that other players can identify me during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player joins the game THEN the system SHALL assign a random unused name like "ShadowKiller", "DeathStrike", etc.
2. WHEN the main menu loads THEN the system SHALL display the assigned nametag below the killtone setting and above the PLAY button
3. WHEN a player wants to change their name THEN they SHALL be able to edit the nametag field
4. WHEN a player sets a custom nametag THEN the system SHALL validate it's 1-20 characters and not already in use
5. WHEN a nametag is set THEN the system SHALL store it locally and update the Player class

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see nametags displayed above all players in the game, so that I can identify who is who during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player is visible on screen THEN the system SHALL display their nametag above their character
2. WHEN a player moves THEN the nametag SHALL follow the player's position
3. WHEN multiple players are nearby THEN nametags SHALL remain readable
4. WHEN a player is partially obscured THEN the nametag SHALL still be visible
5. WHEN rendering nametags THEN the system SHALL use existing rendering methods to avoid bloat

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want nametag information to be synchronized across all clients, so that everyone sees the same names for each player.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player joins THEN the server SHALL broadcast their nametag to all clients using existing network protocols
2. WHEN a player updates their name THEN the server SHALL validate and broadcast the change
3. WHEN a player disconnects THEN their nametag SHALL be removed from all clients
4. WHEN network messages are sent THEN they SHALL integrate with existing message handling
5. WHEN synchronization occurs THEN it SHALL use existing server methods without creating duplicate functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the existing leaderboard to show accurate player information including names, kills, and deaths, so that I can see who is performing well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the leaderboard displays THEN it SHALL show player nametags instead of generic names
2. WHEN a player gets a kill THEN the leaderboard SHALL update their kill count correctly
3. WHEN a player dies THEN the leaderboard SHALL update their death count correctly
4. WHEN players join or leave THEN the leaderboard SHALL add/remove them with correct stats
5. WHEN the leaderboard updates THEN it SHALL use existing leaderboard methods and UI components
