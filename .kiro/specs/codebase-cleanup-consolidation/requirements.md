# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and consolidating the game codebase to eliminate duplicated functionality, improve maintainability, and create better separation of concerns. The analysis reveals 60 duplicate method names across 32 files with a 7.8% duplication rate, along with several large files that could benefit from splitting. The goal is to create a more maintainable, efficient, and well-organized codebase while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicated functionality consolidated into shared utilities, so that I can maintain code more efficiently and reduce bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing method duplicates THEN the system SHALL identify and consolidate identical functionality across files
2. WHEN consolidating duplicates THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality without breaking changes
3. WHEN creating shared utilities THEN the system SHALL place them in appropriate utility modules
4. WHEN refactoring duplicates THEN the system SHALL update all references to use the consolidated versions
5. WHEN consolidating is complete THEN the duplication rate SHALL be reduced by at least 50%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large files split into focused modules, so that the codebase is easier to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying large files THEN the system SHALL target files with more than 25 methods for splitting
2. WHEN splitting files THEN the system SHALL maintain logical grouping of related functionality
3. WHEN creating new modules THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN splitting is complete THEN no single file SHALL contain more than 25 methods
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all imports and dependencies SHALL be properly updated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common patterns abstracted into base classes or mixins, so that I can reduce code repetition and improve consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing common patterns THEN the system SHALL identify repeated initialization, disposal, and update patterns
2. WHEN creating base classes THEN the system SHALL implement common lifecycle methods (initialize, update, dispose)
3. WHEN implementing inheritance THEN the system SHALL preserve existing method signatures and behavior
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN classes SHALL extend appropriate base classes
5. WHEN using base classes THEN the system SHALL reduce method duplication by at least 30%

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want audio-related functionality consolidated into a cohesive audio system, so that audio management is centralized and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating audio THEN the system SHALL merge AudioManager and AudioAdapter into a unified system
2. WHEN refactoring audio THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing audio functionality
3. WHEN organizing audio code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns (playback, effects, state management)
4. WHEN audio consolidation is complete THEN there SHALL be a single entry point for all audio operations
5. WHEN testing audio THEN all existing audio features SHALL work without modification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want weapon-related code organized into a coherent weapon system, so that weapon functionality is easier to extend and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating weapons THEN the system SHALL create a unified weapon management system
2. WHEN organizing weapon code THEN the system SHALL separate weapon types, effects, and ammunition management
3. WHEN refactoring weapons THEN the system SHALL eliminate duplicate methods across weapon classes
4. WHEN creating weapon hierarchy THEN the system SHALL use proper inheritance and composition patterns
5. WHEN weapon consolidation is complete THEN adding new weapons SHALL require minimal code duplication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want effects systems consolidated and optimized, so that visual effects are performant and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating effects THEN the system SHALL merge related effect managers into cohesive modules
2. WHEN organizing effects THEN the system SHALL separate particle effects, blood effects, and flowstate effects appropriately
3. WHEN refactoring effects THEN the system SHALL eliminate duplicate effect creation methods
4. WHEN optimizing effects THEN the system SHALL improve performance through better resource management
5. WHEN effects consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between effect types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling and logging throughout the codebase, so that debugging and maintenance are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing error handling THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling patterns across all modules
2. WHEN adding logging THEN the system SHALL implement structured logging with appropriate levels
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and context
4. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL include relevant debugging information
5. WHEN error handling is complete THEN all modules SHALL follow the same error handling conventions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent architectural patterns, so that new developers can understand and contribute to the project easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing patterns THEN the system SHALL define clear architectural guidelines
2. WHEN refactoring modules THEN the system SHALL follow consistent module organization patterns
3. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions and code structure
4. WHEN documenting code THEN the system SHALL provide clear API documentation and usage examples
5. WHEN architectural refactoring is complete THEN the codebase SHALL follow a consistent and documented architecture

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the consolidation, I want to ensure accurate method identification and avoid creating new duplicates, so that the consolidation process is effective and doesn't introduce new problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting any file modification THEN the system SHALL re-read the method catalog JSON to get current method inventory
2. WHEN identifying methods for consolidation THEN the system SHALL cross-reference the method catalog to ensure accurate method signatures and locations
3. WHEN creating new methods THEN the system SHALL verify against the method catalog that similar functionality doesn't already exist
4. WHEN refactoring existing methods THEN the system SHALL use the method catalog to identify all references and dependencies
5. WHEN consolidation work is complete THEN the system SHALL regenerate the method catalog to verify duplication reduction
