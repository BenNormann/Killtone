# Relevant Information for Networking Refactor

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Networking Structure
- **NetworkManager.js**: Main networking coordinator that delegates to specialized components
- **NetworkConnection.js**: Handles Socket.IO connection (referenced but not examined yet)
- **NetworkMessageHandler.js**: Processes incoming messages (referenced but not examined yet)  
- **NetworkPlayerManager.js**: Manages remote players (referenced but not examined yet)
- **NetworkStats.js**: Tracks network statistics (referenced but not examined yet)

### Player System
- **Player.js**: Local player with FPS camera, movement, weapons, networking sync
- **RemotePlayer.js**: Remote player representation with mesh, name tag, health bar, interpolation
- **PlayerUtils.js**: Utility functions for player operations (referenced but not examined yet)

### Current Issues Identified

#### 1. Bullets/Projectiles
- **Problem**: Bullets do not network or collide with environment
- **Current State**: Player.js fires weapons but projectile networking unclear
- **Need**: ProjectileManager.js examination, bullet collision with Babylon.js physics

#### 2. Health Bars
- **Problem**: Health bars do not render properly above remote players
- **Current State**: RemotePlayer.js has health bar creation but may have positioning issues
- **Need**: Fix 3D-to-2D projection and positioning

#### 3. Username Input
- **Problem**: No separate username input in main menu
- **Current State**: Server assigns default usernames, no UI for input
- **Need**: UI component for username entry

#### 4. Player Stats Display
- **Problem**: Usernames not displayed in tab/leaderboard with accurate stats
- **Current State**: Server tracks score/deaths, but UI display missing
- **Need**: Leaderboard UI component

#### 5. Remote Player Animation
- **Problem**: "trun" mesh (likely "turn" or animation state) not rendering
- **Current State**: RemotePlayer has basic movement interpolation but no state-based animations
- **Need**: Animation state system for walking/running/standing

### Key Methods Found in Catalog
- Movement works as reference - Player.js has comprehensive movement system
- Babylon.js collision methods available via camera.checkCollisions
- Universal camera methods documented for proper camera usage

### Server Implementation
- Socket.IO based with player state tracking
- Handles playerUpdate, playerShoot, bulletHit events
- Tracks health, score, deaths, usernames
- Respawn system implemented

## Detailed Analysis Complete

### Bullet System Analysis
- **ProjectileManager.js**: Comprehensive projectile system with networking support
- **Projectile.js**: Individual projectile entities with collision detection
- **WeaponBase.js**: Weapons create projectiles via `fireProjectile()` method
- **Issue**: Bullets network via server events but collision detection may not be working properly
- **Issue**: Server handles `playerShoot` and `bulletHit` events but client-side collision needs review

### Health Bar Analysis  
- **RemotePlayer.js**: Has health bar creation with 3D-to-2D projection
- **Issue**: `updateUI()` method projects 3D position to screen coordinates but may have positioning bugs
- **Issue**: Health bars should be fixed meshes above players, not GUI elements

### Username System Analysis
- **Server**: Supports username updates via `usernameUpdate` event
- **NetworkPlayerManager**: Handles username updates for remote players
- **Issue**: No UI component for username input in main menu
- **Issue**: UIManager has leaderboard but uses sample data, not real network data

### Remote Player Animation Analysis
- **RemotePlayer.js**: Has basic movement interpolation and simple bob animation
- **Issue**: No state-based animation system for walking/running/standing
- **Issue**: "trun" mesh likely refers to animation states not being properly networked

## TODO LIST

### 1. Fix Bullet Networking and Collision ✅ PRIORITY 1
- [x] Review ProjectileManager networking integration
- [x] Ensure bullets use Babylon.js collision methods like player movement
- [x] Fix server-side bullet hit validation
- [x] Test bullet collision with environment and players

### 2. Fix Health Bars Above Remote Players ✅ PRIORITY 1  
- [x] Replace GUI-based health bars with fixed 3D meshes
- [x] Position health bars as child meshes above player capsules
- [x] Ensure health bars always face camera
- [x] Update health bar fill based on player health

### 3. Add Username Input in Main Menu ✅ PRIORITY 2
- [x] Add username input field to main menu
- [x] Connect username input to server via `usernameUpdate` event
- [x] Store username in local storage for persistence
- [x] Validate username input (length, characters)

### 4. Fix Player Stats Display in Leaderboard ✅ PRIORITY 2
- [x] Connect leaderboard to real network data instead of sample data
- [x] Display actual player usernames, kills, deaths from server
- [x] Update leaderboard in real-time as stats change
- [x] Sort players by score/kills

### 5. Fix Remote Player Animation States ✅ PRIORITY 3
- [x] Add animation state system to RemotePlayer
- [x] Network player movement states (walking, running, standing)
- [x] Create proper animation transitions
- [x] Sync animation states between clients

### Implementation Order
1. Health bars (visual fix, high impact)
2. Username input (UX improvement, medium complexity)  
3. Bullet collision (technical fix, high complexity)
4. Leaderboard data (networking integration, medium complexity)
5. Animation states (visual polish, high complexity)
