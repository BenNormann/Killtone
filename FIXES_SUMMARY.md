# KILLtONE Game Framework - Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PNG Loading Error (Critical)
**Problem**: AssetManager was trying to load PNG images using `ImportMeshAsync`, which is for 3D models only.
**Solution**: 
- Removed the LoadingImage.png from essential assets loading
- Added `loadTexture()` method for proper image loading if needed in future
- Fixed AssetManager to focus on GLB weapon models only

### 2. Module Resolution Error (Critical)
**Problem**: Multiple files were importing `@babylonjs/core` but the project uses CDN-loaded Babylon.js globally.
**Solution**: Removed all `import * as BABYLON from '@babylonjs/core';` statements from:
- `src/entities/Pistol.js`
- `src/entities/Carbine.js`
- `src/entities/WeaponEffects.js`
- `src/entities/Projectile.js`
- `src/entities/AmmoUI.js`
- `src/effects/ParticleManager.js`
- `src/effects/MuzzleFlash.js`
- `src/effects/BloodEffects.js`

### 3. Weapon Model Path Mismatches (Critical)
**Problem**: WeaponConfig.js had incorrect file paths that didn't match actual GLB files.
**Solution**: Updated all weapon model paths to match actual files:
- Carbine: `fps_animated_carbine.glb` ✓
- Pistol: `fps_pistol_animated.glb` ✓
- Shotgun: `shotgun_animated.glb` ✓
- SMG: `fps_smg9_animated.glb` ✓
- Sniper: `fps_50cal.glb` ✓
- Knife: `knife_animated.glb` ✓

### 4. Animation Loading Issues (Important)
**Problem**: WeaponBase wasn't properly handling animation groups from loaded GLB files.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced AssetManager to properly store `animationGroups` from loaded models
- Updated WeaponBase to clone animation groups correctly
- Improved reload animation detection with fallback names (`reload`, `reloadaction`, `action`)
- Added better logging for animation debugging

### 5. Asset Loading Improvements (Important)
**Solution**:
- Fixed AssetManager to load both primary and secondary weapons
- Improved dependency resolution and loading order
- Enhanced progress tracking and error handling
- Added proper GLB file support with animation groups

## Files Modified

### Core Engine Files
- `src/engine/AssetManager.js` - Major fixes for GLB loading and animation handling
- `src/entities/WeaponBase.js` - Enhanced animation handling and model loading
- `src/entities/WeaponConfig.js` - Fixed all weapon model paths

### Weapon Implementation Files
- `src/entities/Pistol.js` - Removed Babylon import
- `src/entities/Carbine.js` - Removed Babylon import

### Effects and UI Files
- `src/entities/WeaponEffects.js` - Removed Babylon import
- `src/entities/Projectile.js` - Removed Babylon import
- `src/entities/AmmoUI.js` - Removed Babylon import
- `src/effects/ParticleManager.js` - Removed Babylon import
- `src/effects/MuzzleFlash.js` - Removed Babylon import
- `src/effects/BloodEffects.js` - Removed Babylon import

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ No more PNG loading errors - AssetManager focuses on GLB models only
2. ✅ No more module resolution errors - All files use global BABYLON object
3. ✅ Weapon models should load correctly with proper file paths
4. ✅ Weapon animations (including reload) should work properly
5. ✅ Game should initialize without critical asset loading failures

## Testing Recommendations

1. Start the game and check console for any remaining errors
2. Test weapon switching in the settings menu
3. Verify reload animations play when reloading weapons
4. Check that all weapon models load without placeholder boxes

## Notes

- The game now properly uses CDN-loaded Babylon.js instead of npm modules
- All weapon GLB files are confirmed to exist and paths are correct
- Animation system is enhanced to handle various animation naming conventions
- Asset loading is more robust with better error handling
